&CONTROL
  ! vc-relax -> optimization of lattice parameters and coordinates
  ! within the constraints of the space group symmetry. In the
  ! wurtzite structure, there are four free parameters:
  ! a, c, and the z-coordinates of the Zn and S atoms.

&SYSTEM
  space_group=186 ! Space group number
  ! For space groups with two different origins, be sure to
  ! choose the origin that matches the input coordinates:
  ! origin_choice=(1 or 2) (see International Tables of Crystallography A)
  a=3.811  ! Lattice parameter a in angstroms
  c=6.234  ! Lattice parameter c in angstroms
  nat=2    ! Number of atoms in the asymmetric unit
  ntyp=2   ! Number of different atom types. Here, Zn and S.
  ! The following plane-wave cutoffs depend on the used pseudopotentials.
  ! The ultrasoft GBRV pseudopotentials have been designed for the following cutoffs.
  ecutwfc=40  ! Kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions (Ry)
  ecutrho=200 ! Kinetic energy cutoff for charge density and potential (Ry)
