# Supporting Information

This repository contains the supporting information for the manuscript
"Free and Open Source Software for Computational Chemistry Education"
by Susi Lehtola and Antti J Karttunen.

The repository contains the practical examples of combining
the Bring Your Own Device approach with Free and Open Source Software
to run quantum chemical calculations (BYOD-FOSS). The examples can 
be found inside the folders 
[xtb](xtb/README.md), 
[NWChem](nwchem/README.md),
[Psi4](psi4/README.md), and
[QE](qe/README.md).

Installation instructions are provided for each code discussed
in the examples. Additional instructions are also provided
for the [Conda](conda.md) open source package manager which can be
used to install all of the codes discussed here.

Short installation instructions are also provided for
[Jmol](jmol.md) open-source Java viewer for chemical structures.

A short overview of how the computers were benchmarked is given in
[the TOP500 benchmark](top500.md) document.
